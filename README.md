## Challenges and Solutions

Although we did not have real clients, we created user stories to define requirements and better divide tasks realistically. This approach allowed us to simulate a work environment and focus on delivering a cohesive project. It was an intense three-week sprint, but we managed to accomplish our goals.  

One of the main challenges was working as a team. Despite having different disciplines and tests to handle simultaneously, we were able to organize our tasks effectively. By supporting each other, we created a website that we are truly proud of.  

It was challenging to maintain a consistent style throughout the project, as each of us had different ways of working. However, we believe the final result is highly satisfactory.  

One area for improvement is the shopping cart button, which only functions properly on the shop page. Despite our efforts to integrate the cart script across all pages, it consistently worked only on the shop page. This was our biggest technical challenge and would need to be addressed in future iterations.
